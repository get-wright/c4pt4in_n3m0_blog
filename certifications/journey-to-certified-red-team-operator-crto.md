# ðŸ¥· Journey to Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)

## Th0ugh7s on the certification

I have just passed the Red Team Operator exam on Saturday. In my personal opinion, RTO was both a little bit difficult and enjoyable. Since the exam went a lot differently than I had anticipated, I wanted to share my ideas in hopes that it may help those who are also getting ready for the test.

## Wh47 is CRTO?

For penetration testers who wish to progress in their career and become red teamers, the certified red team operator certification is an entry-level to intermediate security certification. The applicant will get a chance to test the strategies, methods that cybercriminals employ to compromise IT systems and evade detection and see how it play out in a controlled environment (thus stay true to the statement of "adversary simulation")

There is a course offers by the same author - Daniel Duggan (aka the one and only RastaMouse). His work on Red Team Ops is phenomenal, and he explains most concepts and tactics in a way that is straightforward. (I didn't purchase the course, so the reflection is based solely on the modules I've learnt by borrowing from friends). I would recommend you check it out.
