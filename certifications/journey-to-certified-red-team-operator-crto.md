# âš” Journey to Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)

## Th0ugh7s on the certification

I have just passed the Red Team Operator exam on Saturday. In my personal opinion, RTO was both a little bit difficult and enjoyable. Since the exam went a lot differently than I had anticipated, I wanted to share my ideas in hopes that it may help those who are also getting ready for the test.

## Wh47 is CRTO?

For penetration testers who wish to progress in their career and become red teamers, the certified red team operator certification is an entry-level to intermediate security certification. The applicant will get a chance to test the strategies, methods that cybercriminals employ to compromise IT systems and evade detection and see how it play out in a controlled environment (thus stay true to the statement of "adversary simulation")

There is a course offers by the same author - Daniel Duggan (aka the one and only RastaMouse). His work on Red Team Ops is phenomenal, and he explains most concepts and tactics in a way that is straightforward. (I didn't purchase the course, so the reflection is based solely on the modules I've learnt by borrowing from friends). I would recommend you check it out.

## 4b0u7 the exam

### M4in objective

You would have 4 calendar days, and only 48 hours of time in the exam lab environment. No report writing is required, so take your time. Capturing 6 of the 8 flags will earn you a badge that basically saying that I am good at pretending to be a "real bad actor".&#x20;

The Snap Labs interface allows for the submission of each flag for verification.&#x20;

You have access to a Kali Linux machine, a Windows attack machine, and a machine on the internal network from which you launch your attack (because it's an assumed breach scenario). Snaplab.io provides access through Guacamole so you can run your whole operation on just a few tabs.

* Good: If you have a really reliable & great internet connection, just hop into the lab environment without worrying about anything.
* Bad: Sometimes it would just straight up disconnect (a very minor issue, last only for a few seconds - F5 would solve the problem).

### Threat Profile (Ah! The good old red scare)

This would give you a brief on the hypothetical hacker group, provide some info on your target (lol, real Cobalt Strike for the rich, cracked Cobalt Strike for the mad one)

You cannot import any custom tools (~~say goodbye your tools on github~~) and I hope that you can&#x20;
