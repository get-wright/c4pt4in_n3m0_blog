## Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Untitled design (1).png" alt="" width="225"><figcaption><p>Or at least, this is a very dumb version of me?!</p></figcaption></figure>

My name is Hung and lately I'm really into offensive security right now. Not gonna lie fam, this journey is tough but I'm willing to stick with it. This blog will serve as a repository for all of my tools, scripts, exploits, and thoughts on various topics.

üî¥ My focus right now is on red team (sometimes bug hunting). There will be a dedicated section for HTB machines but right now this site is kind :octagonal\_sign: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :octagonal\_sign:

:sailboat: In the near future, the main focus would be on:

* Active Directory & Abusing Kerberos
* Lateral Movement
* AV evasions & Defense Bypass
* C2 Basics

üìú I'm a holder of following cybersecurity certifications: CRTP, [CRTO](https://api.eu.badgr.io/public/assertions/1yqGbE8GTeKAgTvDfAr8nA?identity\_\_email=Hung.TQ235593%40sis.hust.edu.vn).

So buckle up folks, we got a sea to conquer.&#x20;
